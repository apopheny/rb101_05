# Practice Problem 6
# One of the most frequently used real-world string properties is that of "string substitution", where we take a hard-coded string and modify it with various parameters from our program.

# Given this previously seen family hash, print out the name, age and gender of each family member:

# Copy Code
# munsters = {
#   "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
#   "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
#   "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
#   "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
#   "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
# }
# ...like this:

# Copy Code
# (Name) is a (age)-year-old (male or female).

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

munsters.each { |name, demos| p "#{name} is a #{demos["age"]}-year-old #{demos["gender"]}."}
